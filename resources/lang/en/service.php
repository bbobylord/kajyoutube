        Expertise, creativity, and continuity are undoubtedly the most important keywords that unfortunately are less visible in business world these days.

        'body'=>'Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem solving through the use of typing, space, image and color. The graphic design  is a subdivision of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" can be used, due to complex technical connectivity, rather than  communication design and visual communication. Graphic designers use different ways to combine words, symbols and images in order to create an image of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may combine typography, visual arts, and layout techniques to produce a final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) that creates the connection and what is produced( design).

 

        Common uses of graphic design include identity (logo and brand), publications (journals, newspapers and books), printed ads, posters, billboards, website graphics and elements, signage and product packaging. For example, product packaging may include a logo or other artwork, organized texts, and pure design elements, including pictures, shapes, and colors that form the unified structure of the item. Composition is one of the most important features of graphic design, especially when it comes to the use of existing materials or various elements.
        
        The definition of graphic art is changing over time in anticipation of efficient visual feedback at different times and renews again and again. In the meantime, the requirements of time, challenges, social and political changes, and consequently cultural changes, directly contribute to the emergence of a new concept of art, to the point where, in the present day, it should be accepted that it covers deeper and broader concepts such as "visual communication" ,  visual subjective concepts and traditional visual signage and also includes the familiar idea called graphic design.

                Branding is more than a name and symbol. A brand is created and influenced by people, images, culture, style, perception, words, messages, public relations, beliefs, news media, and especially social media. Just like a baby born and named , a brand needs to be looked after, maintained and constantly paid attention to so that it can flourish. Some brands have a life cycle and get old  just like us. But there are eternal brands that never die, they are born again or re-invented. Meanwhile, the life of some brands is short, but they have a strong life, so that they leave a symbolic heritage.” Lisa Bayer”',
